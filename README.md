# 🏠 House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts the selling price of a house based on features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location advantages, and amenities using machine learning regression models.

## 🚀 Overview

This ML project applies supervised learning techniques to build a regression model that can estimate house prices. It includes:

- Data preprocessing (including handling categorical variables)
- Model training using algorithms like Random Forest, Linear Regression, etc.
- Feature scaling
- Model evaluation
- Deployment-ready structure (with optional web interface)

## 🧠 Features Used

The following features were used to train the model:

- `area`
- `bedrooms`
- `bathrooms`
- `stories`
- `parking`
- `mainroad`
- `guestroom`
- `basement`
- `hotwaterheating`
- `airconditioning`
- `prefarea`
- `furnishingstatus` (converted to multiple binary columns)
